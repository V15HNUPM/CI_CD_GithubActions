# DevOps Learning Projects - GitHub Actions CI/CD

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows using GitHub Actions. Each project showcases different aspects of automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines.

## Projects List

| Project Name | Description | GitHub Actions Workflow |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **BasicFlaskApplication** | A simple Flask web application | `./github/workflows/Basic-Flask.yml` |
| **django-notes-app** | Django-based notes application | `django-notes-app.yml` |
| **simple-java-docker** | Java application with Docker configuration | `gradle.yml` |
| **CI-CD-Pipeline-tutorial** | React Vite project with CI/CD pipeline | `main.yml` |
| **Github-Actions-Project** | Simple Java project with Maven | `maven.yml` |
| **node-express-mongodb** | Node.js Express application with MongoDB | `node.js.yml` |

## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of my learning progress in DevOps CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions, including:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and building of applications
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to various environments
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Managing complex pipeline dependencies
- **Multi-language Support**: CI/CD for Python, Java, JavaScript, and React applications
- **Container Integration**: Docker builds and container registry management

## Technologies Demonstrated

- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Docker** - Containerization and image building
- **Python/Flask/Django** - Python web applications
- **Java** - Maven and Gradle builds
- **Node.js** - JavaScript backend applications
- **React/Vite** - Modern frontend development

## Usage

Each project contains its own GitHub Actions workflow configuration. The workflows demonstrate:

- Automated testing on push and pull requests
- Multi-stage build processes
- Docker image building and pushing
- Deployment to various platforms
- Environment-specific configurations

Refer to individual project directories and workflow files for specific implementation details and pipeline configurations.
